# Day 3

## What I did

- Learned about int and str
- Checked data types with type()
- Tried converting types

## What I learned

- Numbers and strings behave differently
- Python does not mix types automatically
- Types can be converted if needed

## Thoughts

- The result was different then I expected
- Type seems important
